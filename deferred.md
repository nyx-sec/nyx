# Deferred work

Tracking artifact for pitboss runner. Items here are work the current phase
implied or surfaced but did not finish.

## Deferred items

- [ ] Reconcile baseline location with phase 01 plan. Phase 01 deliverable
      named `.pitboss/play/recall_baseline.json`, but pitboss hard rule 2
      forbids implementer agents from writing under `.pitboss/`. Phase 01
      relocated the artifact to `tests/recall_gaps_baseline.json` (committed,
      next to the harness). If a future phase needs the baseline mirrored
      back into `.pitboss/play/`, the runner — not an implementer — must
      copy it.
- [ ] Tighten `ExpectedFinding.sink_line` placeholders. Phase 01 wrote `0`
      for every gap-area test because the fixtures do not exist yet. The
      phase that un-ignores each test must update its `sink_line` (and,
      where stable, `source_line`) to a real fixture line. Phase 03 did
      this for `promise_then_callback`, `promise_all_taint`, and
      `for_await_of_stream`; phase 06 did it for `jsx_dangerous_html`
      (sink_line = 8 on `page.tsx`, the `__html: input` value span);
      phase 07 did it for `orm_builders` (six positives + cap-aware
      assertion on `sqli_typeorm_query.ts`);
      `ssrf_url_builders`, `cross_package_ipa`, and `nextjs_entrypoints`
      still own their own.
- [ ] Chained-receiver Promise shape: `Promise.resolve(req.body).then(cb)`
      and `Promise.all([...]).then(cb)` collapse in CFG (the outer `.then`
      call's text is rewritten to the inner call_expression text), so the
      SSA layer never sees a separate Call op for `.then`. Phase 03 ships
      the named-promise form (`const p = Promise.resolve(x); p.then(cb);`)
      via `try_apply_promise_callback`; the chained-receiver form needs a
      CFG-level fix that emits the outer `.then` as its own node before
      `try_apply_promise_callback` can fire on it. Out of scope for phase
      03 because the CFG rewrite is a cross-cutting change with corpus
      risk.
- [ ] `Promise.all` per-element precision. Phase 03 conservatively unions
      all element taints into a scalar `VarTaint` on the result. Real
      shape is a tuple/array where each index has its own taint; the
      array-element lattice on `VarTaint` would preserve precision so
      destructuring `Promise.all([safe, tainted]).then(([a, b]) => ...)`
      taints only `b`. Park here because a tuple lattice extension is a
      domain-wide change touching every transfer arm.
- [ ] Promise-callback finding attribution. The `.then(cb)` flow currently
      surfaces as a `taint-unsanitised-flow` finding at the `.then(cb)`
      call site (via the engine's existing source-to-callback /
      param-to-sink pairing), and a separate `cfg-unguarded-sink` finding
      still fires at the actual `db.query(data)` line inside `cb`. The
      taint trace's location should attribute to the inner sink site so a
      reviewer reading the diagnostic lands at the dangerous line, not at
      the outer call. Park because this is a reporting-layer change that
      touches every callback-pattern emitter (not just promise callbacks).
- [ ] Phase 04 audit — the plan said "stash the resolved key on
      each import node so passes 1 and 2 can use it" but the actual
      stash is at the file level (`FileCfg.resolved_imports` plus a
      project-wide `ImportTable` keyed by importer path). Per-import
      AST-node stashing would let phases 05/09/10 look up a specific
      `import_clause` node's resolved file without re-parsing the
      file's import list. Park because the file-level lookup
      (`graph.imports_for(file)`) covers the use cases described in
      phases 05/09/10 deliverables; revisit only if a downstream
      consumer needs node-precise resolution.
- [ ] Phase 04 audit — the resolver only consumes JS/TS imports.
      Python `from X import Y`, Java `import a.b.C;`, and Rust
      `use ::path` already have separate resolvers
      (`cfg::imports::extract_import_bindings`, `rust_resolve.rs`).
      A unified `Imports` table covering every language would let
      cross-file taint use a single API; out of scope for the TS/JS
      foundation phase.
- [ ] Phase 05 audit — `JS_TS_HANDLER_PARAM_NAMES` auto-seeding in
      the SSA layer has no relation to the gated rule, but Phase 05
      fixtures revealed that `req.body.path` flows through `req`
      → `path` without explicit auto-seeding because the express
      `Request` typed-extractor pipeline already lights up the
      `req.body` source. If a fixture stops firing because the
      handler-param auto-seed and Phase 05 gate disagree on which
      identifier carries taint, audit `is_js_ts_handler_param_name`
      first.
- [ ] Phase 06 audit — `Kind::JsxAttr` is a unit variant rather
      than the `JsxAttr { name: SmolStr }` variant the phase
      prompt requested.  Reason: `Kind` must remain `Copy` to fit
      `phf_map` storage, and the static KINDS map can only
      construct values from const expressions.  The attribute
      name is read from the AST at the consumption site
      (`jsx_attr_name_is`) instead.  Switch to a fielded variant
      (and drop `Copy`) only if a future phase needs name-bearing
      Kind variants for additional JSX-specific dispatch (e.g.
      multiple synthesised callees per attribute name); today
      one shape (`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) is enough.
- [ ] Phase 06 audit — JSX is recognised only for React TSX/JSX
      via the tree-sitter-typescript and tree-sitter-javascript
      grammars.  Other JSX-flavour template languages (Svelte
      `bind:innerHTML`, Vue `v-html`, Solid's
      `innerHTML` directive) carry the same XSS-by-default
      semantics but use entirely separate grammars.  Out of
      scope; revisit when a gap test arrives for one of those
      ecosystems.
- [ ] Phase 07 audit — `ssa::type_facts::constructor_type` (TS/JS)
      assigns the new ORM TypeKinds (`Sequelize`, `TypeOrmRepo`,
      `TypeOrmManager`, `MikroOrmEm`) by suffix-matching alone, with
      no import-table gate. The phase 07 plan called for
      "Use Phase 04's import table to only assign the TypeKind when
      the symbol resolves to the real ORM package", but threading the
      import map through `optimize_ssa` → `analyze_types_with_param_types`
      → `constructor_type` is invasive (six call sites). The leaf-suffix
      names are distinctive enough that misfires are unlikely on real
      code; revisit when a fixture surfaces a false positive (e.g. an
      app-internal class named `Sequelize` with a `.literal()` helper).
- [ ] Phase 07 audit — `LabelGate::FileImportsModule(&["knex"])` for
      Knex `whereRaw` / `orderByRaw` / `havingRaw` fires whenever any
      file-local binding maps to `knex`, including peripheral imports
      (e.g. `import { Knex } from 'knex'` for type-only use). A
      tighter gate would witness only the query-builder factory call
      (`const db = knex({...})`) but needs receiver-type tracking
      that constructor_type does not currently produce for the bare
      `knex` callee. Revisit when an FP surfaces.
- [ ] Phase 07 audit — `Sequelize` constructor maps to
      `TypeKind::Sequelize` purely from leaf-suffix matching on
      `new_expression`. The mapping fires on `new Sequelize(...)` but
      not on the alternate factory shape `Sequelize.define(...)`
      (which returns a Model class, distinct from the Sequelize
      instance). The plan listed `sequelize.literal` as a factory in
      the constructor_type table, but `sequelize.literal()` returns a
      Literal value, not a Sequelize instance — typing that result as
      `Sequelize` would mis-shape. Skip until a fixture surfaces a
      gap.
